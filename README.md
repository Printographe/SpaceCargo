# SpaceCargo
Godot 4 game I'm working on. It features a spaceship and stuff.
### How to use : 
If you want to help me test my game here is how you can do it :

step 1- Install the latestest version of Godot 4

step 2- Copy the repo from github

step 3- Download the zip file that contains all the ressources which are too big to put on github.

step 4- add the assets to the repo you've just downloaded from github

step 5- Open the game with Godot.

This may take some time since Godot will have to reimport the assets etc.

Once done, you'll have a replica of the game.
I'm working on a small documentation to make your own levels with it with no code required👍

### If you want to help me :
If you're an artist, a programmer or just an average joe who wants to contribute to this game, you can DM me
on discord @printographe to discuss it :)

As of now, I am the only one who's working on the game.
